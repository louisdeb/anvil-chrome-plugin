# anvil-chrome-plugin
Chrome extension to work with Anvil iOS app

This plugin / Chrome app is incomplete and experimental. At the time of development, Chrome did not support sufficient Bluetooth functionality for the project.
Chrome Bluetooth only provided the full Bluetooth communication required for Chrome OS systems. The purpose of this plugin would have been to widen Anvil's user base when concerning computer operating systems.
Since no team member ran Chrome OS, the plugin development stopped.
Communication took place between ourselves, W3 developers and Chrome developers when trying to determine how to use Chrome's Bluetooth functionality. Conflicting documentation made our task harder.
